# OIBGRIP-Landing-page
#Welcome to the Landline Page Project!

This project will help you create a fully functioning webpage using HTML and CSS. The webpage will be a landing page for the fic nal company Landline. The goal of the project is to create a webpage that allows users to navigate to the different areas of the website, learn more about the company and its services, and contact Landline for more information.

To get started, you will need to create an HTML page and a CSS page. The HTML page will be the main page of the website, and the CSS page will be used to style the website.

Once your HTML and CSS pages are created, you will need to create the content for the website. This includes text, images, and other elements. You will also need to create a navigation bar so that users can easily navigate to the different areas of the website.

Once the HTML page and CSS page are finished, you will need to add in any additional features or functionality that you desire. This could include things like a contact form, a map, or other elements.

Finally, you will need to validate the HTML and CSS pages. This will ensure that the website is functioning correctly and looks great on all devices.
